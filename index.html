        <ul>Damon Albarn is an English musician, singer-songwriter and composer, best known as the frontman and primary lyricist of the rock band Blur and as the co-founder, and primary musical contributor for the virtual band Gorillaz.</ul>
      <li><span>Blur</span>- 
        Albarn enrolled on a part-time music course at London's Goldsmiths College in 1988, claiming that his sole intention was to gain access to the student union bar.Albarn was in a group named Circus alongside Coxon and drummer Dave Rowntree.Alex James, a fellow student at Goldsmiths, eventually joined as the group's bassist. They changed their name to Seymour in December 1988, inspired by J.D. Salinger's Seymour: An Introduction. In March 1990, after changing their name to Blur, they signed to Food Records.</li>
      <li><span>Gorillaz</span>- In the late 1990s Albarn and comic-book artist Jamie Hewlett developed the idea for Gorillaz, a “virtual band” for which animated characters drawn by Hewlett would serve as the sole visual component (on record covers and in music videos, for instance) of music conceived by Albarn. </li>
